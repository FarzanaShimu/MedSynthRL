### MedSynthRL: GANs for Synthetic Patient Data in Reinforcement Learning Healthcare Simulations

![MedSynthRL Logo](link/to/logo.png)

### Overview

MedSynthRL is a groundbreaking project that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic synthetic patient data. This synthetic data is instrumental in training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for medical decision-making and diagnosis within healthcare simulations.
